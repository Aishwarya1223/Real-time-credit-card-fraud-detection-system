Real-Time Credit Card Fraud Detection System

-> Architecture Overview

This project implements a real-time credit card fraud detection system using a combination of Docker, AWS Lambda, S3, EventBridge, Kinesis, ECR, CloudWatch, DynamoDB, and SNS. It is built to automatically detect fraudulent credit card transactions with low latency and high scalability.

1. Docker & ECR: Lambda Container Deployment

- A Docker image is built locally with all dependencies and a Python-based preprocessing + prediction script.
- The image is pushed to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
- A Lambda function is created from this container to handle preprocessing and prediction.

2. User Transaction Interface (Desktop App)

- End users simulate or initiate transactions via a desktop application.
- These transactions are stored locally in CSV format.
- The CSV files are then uploaded to an S3 bucket for processing.

3. Event-Driven Processing with AWS Services

- AWS CloudTrail is used to monitor S3 events.
- When a new file is uploaded to S3, an EventBridge rule is triggered.
- EventBridge routes the event to the Lambda function.
- Dead Letter Queue (SQS) is configured to catch failed event processing.

4. Lambda Trigger & File Check

- The triggered Lambda:
  - Validates if the uploaded file is a .csv.
  - Converts the CSV data into JSON format.
  - Sends this JSON data to Amazon Kinesis for stream processing.

5. Preprocessing & Classification with Lambda + ECR

- Another Lambda function (from the ECR image) is triggered:
  - It contacts S3 to download a preprocessing Python script (.py file).
  - Applies the exact same preprocessing as was used during model training.
  - Converts JSON to a Pandas DataFrame for smoother handling.
  - Loads the trained classifier model from S3.
  - Performs fraud prediction on the transaction.

6. Logging & Monitoring

- All transformation steps and errors are logged to Amazon CloudWatch Logs for observability and debugging.

7. Storage & Alerting

- Final predictions (with transaction details) are stored in Amazon DynamoDB.
- If a transaction is classified as fraudulent, a Simple Notification Service (SNS) sends an email alert to the admin.

8. Failure Handling

- If the Lambda function fails during execution, the event is routed to the Dead Letter Queue (SQS) for inspection and retries.

9. Cost Optimization & Archival

- Lifecycle policies are applied on S3:
  - Files older than a threshold (e.g., 180 days) are automatically moved to Glacier (archival).
  - Eventually, these files are deleted to reduce storage costs.

-> Technologies Used
Service	Purpose
Docker + ECR	Containerized Lambda deployment
AWS Lambda	Serverless compute for preprocessing + classification
Amazon S3	Storage for transaction files and models
EventBridge + CloudTrail	Event routing upon new S3 uploads
Amazon Kinesis	Real-time JSON stream processing
Amazon DynamoDB	NoSQL database to store transaction predictions
Amazon CloudWatch	Monitoring and logging
Amazon SNS	Alerting system (Email) for fraud detection
SQS DLQ	Handling unprocessed or failed events
-> Alerts

Admins receive email notifications immediately after a fraudulent transaction is detected via SNS.

-> Security

IAM roles are configured to:
- Allow Lambda functions to access only required resources (S3, Kinesis, ECR).
- Trigger Lambda only via authorized EventBridge rules.

ðŸ§Š Cost Control

- S3 Lifecycle Policies archive and delete old transaction data.
- Serverless and stream-based design ensures pay-per-use billing.
